    <h2>What is aquaponics?</h2>
    <p>Aquaponics is a food production system that couples aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as fish, crayfish, snails or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) whereby the nutrient-rich aquaculture water is fed to hydroponically grown plants
         </p>
    <h2>
        How does it work?
    </h2>
    <p>The fish actually provide the fertilizer for the plants and the plant roots filter the water for the fish. When fish are introduced to a freshwater source, they give off ammonia through their gills and waste (pee and poop!). Over time, nitrifying bacteria - naturally-occurring microorganisms - begin to grow on all the surface area under the water. This bacteria converts the fish waste into nitrites, and eventually nitrates, which is plant food. So aquaponic farms actually grow three separate, equally important things, plants, fish and beneficial bacteria. With the correct ratio of plants to fish, an aquaponic system can be a very sustainable and fun way to grow food.
        When using an aquaponics system, nitrogen is perfectly balanced in the water, which means that the water should never have to be replaced.

    <h2>
        what kind of plants can you grow!
    </h2>
    <p>chinese cabbage, lettuce, basil, spinach, chives, watercress,coriander, parsley, lemongrass, sage.
        tomatoes, cucumber,capsicum, onions, peas,beans,radishes, strawberries, melons, onions, turnips, parsnips, sweet potato, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, eggplant 
        <h2>What kind of fisches can you use?</h2>
        <p>
            Freshwater fish are the most common aquatic animal raised using aquaponics due to their ability to tolerate crowding. 

 Tilapia are the most popular fish for home and commercial projects that are intended to raise edible fish  or barramundi, silver perch, eel-tailed catfish, tandanus catfish, jade perch and Murray cod are also used.

Koi and goldfish may also be used, if the fish in the system need not be edible.

            Advantages of Soilless Agriculture
        </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Faster growth: 30-50 percent faster than their traditional soil-based counterparts.More grow cycles per year and more yield, around 30-40 percent more than other growing methods. 
              This quick growth occurs because the plants have access to a higher amount of oxygen, what helps to encourage root growth and nutrient absorption.
        </li>
        <li>
            Extreme decrease in water and nutrient use: By closing the loop and recycling the water through the system, uses at least 90% less water than soil-based methods. (So much of the water and nutrients are wasted on traditional outdoor soil farms because only a small portion of it actually makes it to the roots, and the rest ends up in the local water supply)
        </li>
        <li> 
            Pesticides can be avoided.Organic growth,aquaponics systems require non-chemical methods to make sure that the fish arenâ€™t harmed.

        </li>
      
        <li>Location: The farm can and should be significantly closer to the end consumer, decreasing the carbon footprint of delivery and increasing the freshness of the product. Since there is no dependence on soil fertility, this kind of growing can be done anywhere.</li>
       <li>
        Use significantly less space: With stacked, or vertical systems.
    </li>
